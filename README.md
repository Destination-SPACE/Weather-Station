## What is the Destination Weather Station?
The Destination Weather Station is a Arduino based weather station that collects, displays, and stores tempreture, pressure, and humidity data. This weather station runs on a Seeeduino XIAO by Seeed Studio and uses a custom BME280 weather sensor module to collect data. This data is then saved on a MicroSD card so data can easily be ported to the users computer.
